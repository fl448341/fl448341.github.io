<p>The Albin Counter-Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5. This is an aggressive response to the Queen’s Gambit, where Black immediately challenges the center by attacking the pawn on c4. The main idea for Black is to gain space and control the center, while also threatening to win the pawn on c4. The Albin Counter-Gambit is named after the Romanian chess master Adolf Albin, who popularized this opening in the late 19th century. It is considered a risky but dynamic opening, as Black sacrifices a pawn in the hopes of gaining a strong initiative and counterattacking opportunities.</p>
