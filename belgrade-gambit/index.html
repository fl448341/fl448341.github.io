<p>The Belgrade Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 exd4. This opening is characterized by White sacrificing a pawn in the center in order to gain control of the center and develop their pieces quickly. The Belgrade Gambit is considered an aggressive and risky opening for White, as Black can often counter-attack and regain the sacrificed pawn. However, if played correctly, the Belgrade Gambit can lead to dynamic and complex positions that can be difficult for Black to handle.</p>
