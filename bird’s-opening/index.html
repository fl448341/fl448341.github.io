<p>Bird’s Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. f4, known as the Bird’s Opening or the Dutch Fianchetto. This opening is characterized by the early development of the bishop to g5, aiming to control the center and prepare a kingside attack. The typical continuation is 1. f4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg5, where Black often responds with 4…Bg7 to defend the pawn on d5. Bird’s Opening is considered an unambitious opening, as it does not directly challenge the center, but it can lead to sharp and tactical positions if Black decides to counter-attack in the center.</p>
