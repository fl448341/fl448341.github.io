<p>Bishop’s Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 c5 2. Bc4. This opening is named after the bishop’s early development to the c4 square, which aims to control the center and put pressure on the opponent’s pawn structure. The typical continuation is 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Nf3 d6 5. d3, where White develops the knight and prepares to castle, while Black solidifies the center with the pawn on d6. Bishop’s Opening is considered a sound and flexible opening for White, as it allows for a variety of strategic plans depending on how Black responds.</p>
