<p>The Black Knights Tango is an uncommon chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5. This opening is characterized by Black’s early development of the knight to c6, challenging the center and preparing to launch an attack on the e4 pawn. The name ‘Black Knights Tango’ refers to the dance-like movement of the black knights, which often play a central role in the resulting positions. While not a mainstream opening, the Black Knights Tango can lead to sharp and tactical positions, making it an interesting choice for players looking to surprise their opponents.</p>
