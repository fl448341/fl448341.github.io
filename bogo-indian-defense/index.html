<p>The Bogo Indian Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+. This opening is characterized by Black’s early development of the bishop to the b4 square, challenging White’s control of the center. The Bogo Indian is considered a solid and flexible response to 1. d4, as it allows Black to develop their pieces actively while maintaining control over the center. The opening often leads to complex positional battles, with both sides maneuvering to gain an advantage in the center and on the flanks.</p>
