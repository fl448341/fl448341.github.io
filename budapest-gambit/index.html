<p>The Budapest Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5. This opening is characterized by Black’s early commitment to the e5-pawn, which can lead to sharp and tactical positions. The main idea behind the Budapest Gambit is for Black to challenge the center and gain active counterplay, often at the cost of a pawn. After the initial moves, the game can take various paths, with common continuations including 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Bf4 Nc6 5. Nc3. The Budapest Gambit is considered an ambitious and unbalanced opening, offering both opportunities and risks for both players.</p>
