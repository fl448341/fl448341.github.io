<p>The Calabrese Countergambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 f5. This opening is characterized by Black’s immediate counterattack against White’s center, challenging the control of the e4 pawn. The Calabrese Countergambit is considered an aggressive and risky opening for Black, as it can lead to sharp and tactical positions. However, if played correctly, it can provide Black with active play and opportunities to seize the initiative. The opening is named after the Italian chess player Vincenzo Calabrese, who popularized this variation in the late 19th century.</p>
