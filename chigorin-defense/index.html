<p>The Chigorin Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6. This opening is named after the Russian chess master Mikhail Chigorin, who popularized it in the late 19th century. The Chigorin Defense is characterized by Black’s early development of the knight to c6, which aims to control the center and prepare to launch a counterattack against White’s pawn on c4. The opening often leads to complex and dynamic positions, with both players vying for control of the center and the initiative. The Chigorin Defense is considered a solid and reliable opening for Black, and it has been employed by many strong grandmasters over the years.</p>
