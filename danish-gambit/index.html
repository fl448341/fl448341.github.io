<p>The Danish Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3. This is an aggressive opening where White sacrifices a pawn in order to gain rapid development and control of the center. The idea behind the Danish Gambit is for White to quickly develop their pieces and put pressure on Black’s position. After the initial pawn sacrifice, White typically follows up with moves like Nc3, Bc4, and Qb3, aiming to quickly mobilize their forces and create threats against the black king. The Danish Gambit is considered a risky but dynamic opening that can lead to sharp, tactical positions if Black does not find the correct defensive responses.</p>
