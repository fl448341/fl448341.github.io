<p>The Elephant Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Bg4. This opening is considered unorthodox and risky for White, as it allows Black to quickly develop their pieces and potentially launch a counterattack against White’s center. The name ‘Elephant Gambit’ comes from the unusual placement of the bishop on c4, which resembles an elephant’s trunk. While not a commonly played opening at the highest levels, the Elephant Gambit can be an interesting choice for players looking to surprise their opponents and try something a bit different from the more mainstream openings.</p>
