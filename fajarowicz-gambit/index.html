<p>The Fajarowicz Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3. This opening is named after the Polish chess player Józef Fajarowicz, who popularized it in the late 19th century. The Fajarowicz Gambit is characterized by White’s early development of the knight to f3 and the bishop to c4, aiming to control the center and create threats against Black’s king. Black typically responds by developing the knight to f6 and the bishop to c5, setting up a complex positional battle in the center. The Fajarowicz Gambit is considered an aggressive and somewhat risky opening for White, as it can lead to sharp and tactical positions if Black finds the right counterattacking ideas.</p>
