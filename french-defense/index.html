<p>The French Defense is a popular chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e6. This opening is characterized by Black’s decision to defend the center with the pawn on e6, rather than immediately challenging the center with moves like 1…c5 (the Sicilian Defense) or 1…d5 (the Caro-Kann Defense). The typical continuation of the French Defense is 2. d4 d5, where Black stakes a claim in the center and prepares to counterattack. White then has several options, such as 3. Nc3, 3. exd5, or 3. Bd3, each of which leads to distinct variations of the French Defense. The French Defense is known for its solid and strategic nature, often leading to complex and maneuvering positions.</p>
