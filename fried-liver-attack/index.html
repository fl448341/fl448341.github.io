<p>The Fried Liver Attack is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5. This aggressive opening aims to quickly develop the knight to a strong outpost on g5, where it attacks the f7 pawn, a weak point in Black’s position. The Fried Liver Attack is characterized by its sharp and tactical nature, often leading to complex positions where both players must calculate deeply to find the best moves. While risky, the Fried Liver Attack can provide White with excellent chances to seize the initiative and put pressure on the opponent’s position in the early stages of the game.</p>
