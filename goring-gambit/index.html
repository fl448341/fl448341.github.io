<p>The Göring Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3. This opening is named after the German chess player Carl August Göring. The Göring Gambit is considered an aggressive and risky opening for White, as White sacrifices a pawn in the center in order to gain rapid development and control of the center. The opening leads to sharp and tactical positions, where both sides must play accurately to maintain an advantage. While not as popular as some other openings, the Göring Gambit can be an effective way for White to surprise and unbalance their opponent in the early stages of the game.</p>
