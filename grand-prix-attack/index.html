<p>The Grand Prix Attack is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4. This opening is characterized by an early attack on the center, with White developing quickly and aiming to put pressure on Black’s position. The main idea is to control the center and then launch an attack on the kingside, often with the move g4. The Grand Prix Attack is a popular choice for White players looking to take the initiative and put their opponent under pressure from an early stage of the game.</p>
