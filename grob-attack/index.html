<p>The Grob Attack is an uncommon chess opening that begins with the moves 1. g4. This aggressive and unorthodox opening aims to quickly control the center and limit the opponent’s development. The typical continuation goes 1. g4 d5 2. Bg5 Nc6 3. Nf3 Bg4, where White tries to undermine Black’s pawn structure and create weaknesses. The Grob Attack is considered a risky opening that can lead to sharp and tactical positions, making it an interesting choice for players looking to surprise their opponents and take the initiative early in the game.</p>
