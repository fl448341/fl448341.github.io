<p>The Grunfeld Defense is a dynamic and complex chess opening that arises after the moves 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6. Black’s strategy is to challenge White’s center with the move …d5, aiming to create an imbalanced position with chances for both sides. The Grunfeld is characterized by the pawn structure where Black’s pawns on c7, d5, and e7 form a ‘Grunfeld pawn formation.’ This opening leads to sharp, tactical positions where both players must be well-versed in the nuances of the resulting structures and typical plans. The Grunfeld has been a favorite of many world-class players and is considered one of the most theoretically complex openings in chess.</p>
