<p>The Halloween Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nxe5. This opening is named after the fact that it was first played on Halloween in 1895 by Harry Nelson Pillsbury against Emanuel Lasker. The Halloween Gambit is considered a risky opening for White, as it involves sacrificing a pawn in the hopes of gaining a strong initiative and attacking chances. However, if Black plays accurately, White may find it difficult to maintain the advantage. The opening is not commonly played at the highest levels of chess, but it can still provide an interesting and tactical game for players looking to surprise their opponents.</p>
