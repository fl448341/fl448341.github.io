<p>The Hungarian Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4. This opening is characterized by Black’s early development of the knight to c6, challenging the center and preparing to support the pawn on e5. The Hungarian Defense is considered a solid and flexible opening for Black, as it allows for a variety of strategic plans and counterattacking possibilities. The opening often leads to complex and dynamic positions, where both players must navigate a delicate balance between control of the center and the development of their pieces.</p>
