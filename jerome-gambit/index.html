<p>The Jerome Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Bxf7+. This opening is named after the American chess player Jerome Stafford, who popularized it in the late 19th century. The key idea behind the Jerome Gambit is to sacrifice a pawn (the bishop on f7) in order to gain a quick initiative and attack the opponent’s king. While the gambit is considered unsound from a theoretical perspective, it can be an interesting and tricky opening to play, especially at the amateur level, as it can catch opponents off guard with its aggressive and unorthodox approach.</p>
