<p>The Kings Indian Attack is a chess opening strategy that is characterized by a specific setup of the white pieces. The typical first 3-5 moves are: 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 g6 3. Bg5 Bg7 4. Nc3 d6 5. d3. This opening allows White to control the center without committing to an early pawn advance, while also developing the pieces and preparing to castle kingside. The Kings Indian Attack is a flexible and positional approach that can lead to a variety of middle-game structures, making it a popular choice among chess players at all levels.</p>
