<p>The King’s Gambit is an aggressive chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e5 2. f4. White sacrifices a pawn in the center in order to gain rapid development and control of the center. The typical continuation is 2…exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5. This opening leads to sharp, tactical positions where both sides must play accurately to maintain an advantage. The King’s Gambit was very popular in the 19th century but has fallen out of favor at the highest levels of chess today, as modern players have found ways to neutralize White’s initiative.</p>
