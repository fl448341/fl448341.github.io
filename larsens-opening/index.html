<p>Larsens Opening, also known as the Nimzo-Larsen Attack, is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. b3. This is an unusual first move that aims to control the center indirectly by supporting the development of the bishop on c1. The typical continuation is 1. b3 d5 2. Bb2 Nf6 3. e3, where White develops the bishop to b2 and the pawn to e3, creating a solid and flexible position. Larsens Opening is considered a hypermodern opening, as White does not immediately occupy the center with pawns, but instead aims to control it from the flanks. It is a less common opening choice, but can lead to interesting and complex positions.</p>
