<p>The Latvian Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f5. This opening is characterized by Black sacrificing a pawn in the center in order to gain rapid development and counterattacking chances. The typical continuation is 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 fxe4 5. Nc3, where Black aims to create threats against White’s king while trying to recover the sacrificed pawn. The Latvian Gambit is considered a risky but dynamic opening that can lead to sharp and tactical positions, making it an interesting choice for players seeking to unbalance the game from the very start.</p>
