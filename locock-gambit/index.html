<p>The Locock Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3. This opening is named after the English chess player and theorist John Locock, who analyzed and popularized this variation in the late 19th century. The Locock Gambit is characterized by White’s early development of the knight to f3 and the bishop to c4, aiming to control the center and prepare to castle quickly. Black’s typical response is to develop the knight to f6 and prepare to castle as well, leading to a complex and tactical position where both sides have opportunities to seize the initiative.</p>
