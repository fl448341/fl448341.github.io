<p>The Lolli Attack is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3. This opening is characterized by White’s early development of the knight to f3 and the bishop to c4, aiming to control the center and prepare to castle quickly. The name ‘Lolli Attack’ comes from the Italian chess player Vincenzo Lolli, who popularized this opening in the 18th century. The Lolli Attack is considered a solid and positional approach for White, as it allows for the development of the pieces and the control of the center, while also providing opportunities for a kingside attack if Black’s position becomes too passive.</p>
